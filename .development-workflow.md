# Development Workflow

Your go-to guide for AI-assisted development.

## Current Status
- **Version:** v0.2.3 ✅
- **Phase:** Complete Lesson System + Profile Sync (Ready)
- **Last Updated:** Session 5 (2025-12-29)
- **Status:** Fully synced MVP - Ready for Phase 2 (State Management & Database)

## Quick Start (For AI)

### Before Starting Work
1. Check [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) — what's done, what's next
2. Check relevant feature doc in [docs/features/](docs/features/)
3. Review [docs/01_architecture.md](docs/01_architecture.md) for patterns

### During Work
- Follow patterns in existing code
- Update feature doc if architecture changes
- Test on simulator before finishing

### After Work
1. Update [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) with what's done
2. Add session notes to [docs/daily.md](docs/daily.md)
3. **Don't create new .md files** — consolidate in existing ones

## How to Use This Workflow

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Feature
1. Read [docs/00_vision.md](docs/00_vision.md) to align with goals
2. Check [docs/01_architecture.md](docs/01_architecture.md) for patterns
3. Check relevant [docs/features/](docs/features/) doc
4. Implement following patterns
5. Update PROGRESS.md → "In Progress" → "Completed"
6. Add notes to [docs/daily.md](docs/daily.md)

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix / Polish
1. Check [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for context
2. Find relevant [docs/features/](docs/features/) doc
3. Make fix
4. Test
5. Update PROGRESS.md version notes

### Scenario 3: Deep Dive on Code
1. Check [docs/02_project_structure.md](docs/02_project_structure.md)
2. Check [docs/01_architecture.md](docs/01_architecture.md)
3. Check [docs/features/](docs/features/) for that feature

## Key Principles

### Documentation
- **One source of truth per feature** → docs/features/FEATURE.md
- **Don't duplicate** → reference other docs instead
- **Update PROGRESS.md only** after sessions (not individual feature files)
- **Never delete files** unless told explicitly

### Code
- Follow existing patterns in lib/
- Test before finishing
- Keep components in core/widgets if reusable
- Use mock data in domain entities, real logic in data layer

### AI Workflow
- Read this file first on every session
- Check PROGRESS.md for current state
- Update PROGRESS.md when done
- Add session notes to docs/daily.md
- Never create new docs without asking

## What's Working Now (v0.2.3)

✅ **Full Lesson progression** (15 lessons, 5 per difficulty)
✅ **Dynamic Profile** (synced with actual lesson completion)
✅ **Level System** (Newbie → Legend, auto-calculated)
✅ **Achievement Unlocks** (6 achievements, dynamic logic)
✅ **Progress Tracking** (real-time stats and EXP)
✅ **Visual Polish** (animations, consistent spacing, dividers)
✅ **Native Ads** (Lessons, Wallet, Practice)

## Next Phase Priority (Phase 2 - State Management & Persistence)
1. **BLoC Setup** → Add BLoC pattern for lesson progress, user state, achievements
2. **Drift Database** → Persist lesson completion, user progress, achievements
3. **Data Sync** → Move from mock data to persistent storage
4. **User Authentication** → Firebase or custom auth system
5. **API Integration** → Real lesson content, user data from server
6. **Analytics** → Track engagement, completion rates, achievements
